```bash
pip install .
```

Step 3: Verify installation

```bash
vortex --help
```

You should see the help menu with available commands.

### Installation Method 3: From PyPI (When Released)

Once Vortex is published to PyPI, you can install directly:

```bash
pip install vortex
```

Then verify:

```bash
vortex --help
```

### Troubleshooting Installation

**Problem: "python: command not found" or "pip: command not found"**

Solution: Python is not installed or not in your PATH.

- Windows: Install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and check "Add Python to PATH"
- macOS: Install with `brew install python3`
- Linux: Install with `sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip`

**Problem: "Permission denied" when running pip**

Solution: Use the `--user` flag:

```bash
pip install --user -e .
```

**Problem: "git: command not found"**

Solution: Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download)

## Uninstallation

### Complete Uninstallation Steps

Follow these steps in order to completely remove Vortex from your system.

### Step 1: Stop Any Running Vortex Servers

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
vortex --stop
```

If no server is running, you will see: `No running Vortex server found.`

### Step 2: Uninstall the Python Package

```bash
pip uninstall vortex
```

When prompted, type `y` and press Enter to confirm.

If you installed in editable mode, also run:

```bash
pip uninstall -e .
```

### Step 3: Remove Configuration Files (Optional)

Vortex stores tokens and certificates in your home directory. To remove these:

**On Windows:**
```bash
rmdir %USERPROFILE%\.vortex
```

**On macOS and Linux:**
```bash
rm -rf ~/.vortex
```

### Step 4: Remove Source Code (If Using Git)

If you cloned from Git, remove the directory:

**On Windows (Command Prompt):**
```bash
rmdir /s vortex
```

**On macOS and Linux:**
```bash
rm -rf vortex
```

### Step 5: Verify Uninstallation

```bash
vortex --help
```

You should see: `vortex: command not found` or equivalent error message.

If successful, Vortex is completely uninstalled.

### Keeping Configuration Files

If you want to keep your tokens and certificates for future use, do NOT remove the `~/.vortex` directory in Step 3.

### Keeping Source Code

If you plan to reinstall from the same directory, do NOT remove the `vortex` directory in Step 4.

## Quick Start

### Starting Vortex

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
vortex --start
```

The server will start in the current directory and display output like:

```
Vortex active
Serving directory: /Users/you/Desktop
Share this on your network: http://192.168.1.100:8000
Max concurrent connections: 100
Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

### Opening in Browser

1. Copy the URL from the output (example: `http://192.168.1.100:8000`)
2. Open a web browser on another device connected to the same WiFi network
3. Paste the URL into the address bar
4. You can now upload and download files

### Stopping Vortex

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
vortex --stop
```

Or press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the server is running.

### Basic Examples

Share the current directory:

```bash
vortex --start
```

Share a specific directory:

```bash
vortex --start --dir ~/Downloads
```

Use a custom port:

```bash
vortex --start --port 3000
```

Combine multiple options:

```bash
vortex --start --dir ~/Documents --port 9000
```

Share a network drive:

```bash
vortex --start --dir /Volumes/NetworkDrive
```

Windows: Share a specific drive:

```bash
vortex --start --dir "D:\My Documents"
```

## Usage

### Basic Operation

1. Start the server with `vortex --start`
2. Note the URL displayed in the terminal
3. Open the URL in a web browser on another device
4. Upload files by clicking "Choose files" and then "Send"
5. Download files by clicking the file name
6. Stop the server with `vortex --stop`

### Selecting Different Directories

**Share your Downloads folder:**

```bash
vortex --start --dir ~/Downloads
```

**Share a specific project folder:**

```bash
vortex --start --dir ~/Projects/MyProject
```

**Share a shared folder on your network (macOS):**

```bash
vortex --start --dir /Volumes/SharedFolder
```

**Share a network drive (Windows):**

```bash
vortex --start --dir "\\192.168.1.50\SharedFolder"
```

### Using Custom Ports

Default port is 8000. If this port is already in use, specify a different port:

```bash
vortex --start --port 3000
```

Then access at: `http://192.168.1.100:3000`

Common alternative ports:
- 3000 - Standard development port
- 5000 - Flask development port
- 8080 - Common HTTP alternative
- 9000 - High numbered port

### Understanding IP Addresses

When you start Vortex, you see an IP address like `192.168.1.100`. This is your local network address. Other devices must be on the same WiFi network to access it.

**Private IP ranges (local network only):**
- 192.168.x.x (most common)
- 10.x.x.x (enterprise networks)
- 172.16.x.x to 172.31.x.x (less common)

**Localhost (this computer only):**
- 127.0.0.1 or `localhost`

## Advanced Features

### Network Address Mode Selection

The `--mode` flag controls how Vortex detects the network address:

```bash
vortex --start --mode auto
```

**Available modes:**

1. **auto (default)** - Automatically detects your LAN IP. Falls back to localhost if no network is available.

2. **localhost** - Binds to 127.0.0.1. Only accessible from this computer. Useful for testing.

3. **lan** - Requires a LAN IP. Fails if no local network is detected. Useful when you always want LAN access.

**Examples:**

Test locally before sharing:

```bash
vortex --start --mode localhost
```

Then visit: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

Require LAN access (fail if no network):

```bash
vortex --start --mode lan
```

Use automatic detection (default):

```bash
vortex --start --mode auto
```

### Token Authentication

Token authentication restricts file access to users who provide a secret token.

**Start with token authentication:**

```bash
vortex --start --secure
```

Output:

```
Vortex active
Serving directory: /Users/you/Desktop
Share this on your network: http://192.168.1.100:8000?token=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8

🔐 Token authentication ENABLED
   Access URL: http://192.168.1.100:8000?token=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8
   Token: a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8
```

**How tokens work:**

- A 16-character random token is generated automatically
- The token persists to `~/.vortex/token.txt` across server restarts
- Clients must include the token in the URL: `?token=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8`
- Requests without the correct token receive a 403 Unauthorized error
- Rate limiting (200 requests/minute) is always enabled

**Regenerate a new token:**

```bash
vortex --start --secure --new-token
```

This generates a new token. Previous tokens will no longer work.

**Using tokens with clients:**

In browser: `http://192.168.1.100:8000?token=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8`

In HTTP header: `X-Token: a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8`

### HTTPS (Encrypted Connections)

HTTPS encrypts all traffic between your browser and the server using a self-signed certificate.

**Start with HTTPS:**

```bash
vortex --start --https
```

Output:

```
Vortex active
Serving directory: /Users/you/Desktop
Share this on your network: https://192.168.1.100:8000

🔒 HTTPS ENABLED (self-signed certificate)
   Browsers may show a security warning - this is expected.
```

**How HTTPS works:**

- A self-signed certificate is generated automatically on first use
- Certificate is stored in `~/.vortex/certificate.pem` and reused on subsequent runs
- Traffic is encrypted even though the certificate is not from a trusted authority
- Browsers will show a security warning because the certificate is self-signed (this is normal)
- Requires OpenSSL to be installed

**Accepting the browser security warning:**

When you visit an HTTPS URL, your browser will show a security warning.

Chrome/Edge:
1. Click "Advanced"
2. Click "Proceed to 192.168.x.x (unsafe)"

Firefox:
1. Click "Advanced"
2. Click "Accept the Risk and Continue"

Safari:
1. Click "Show Details"
2. Click "visit this website"

After clicking through the warning, you can use Vortex normally. The connection is encrypted.

**Installing OpenSSL (required for HTTPS on Windows):**

macOS (pre-installed, but can update):

```bash
brew install openssl
```

Linux - Debian/Ubuntu (pre-installed, but can update):

```bash
sudo apt-get install openssl
```

Linux - Fedora/RHEL (pre-installed, but can update):

```bash
sudo yum install openssl
```

Windows (not pre-installed):

1. Download from [slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)
2. Run the installer
3. Choose "Install OpenSSL in C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64" or your preferred location
4. Restart your computer

### Combining Security Features

Use multiple security features together for maximum protection:

```bash
vortex --start --https --secure
```

This enables:
- HTTPS encryption (encrypts all traffic)
- Token authentication (restricts access)
- Rate limiting (200 requests/minute, always enabled)

Output:

```
Vortex active
Serving directory: /Users/you/Desktop
Share this on your network: https://192.168.1.100:8000?token=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8

🔐 Token authentication ENABLED
   Access URL: https://192.168.1.100:8000?token=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8
   Token: a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8

🔒 HTTPS ENABLED (self-signed certificate)
   Browsers may show a security warning - this is expected.
```

**Rate limiting (always enabled):**

- Maximum: 200 requests per minute per IP address
- Cannot be disabled
- Purpose: Prevent brute force attacks and DoS attacks
- Normal users will not hit this limit

### File Download as ZIP

Download an entire directory as a compressed ZIP file.

In the web interface:
1. Navigate to any directory
2. Click the "Download All" button
3. All files in that directory download as a ZIP file

This is useful for downloading multiple files at once.

### HTTP Range Requests

HTTP Range requests allow you to resume downloads and seek in media files.

Resume downloads:
- Start a download, then pause it
- Resume later from where you paused (if the server is still running)

Seek in media:
- Video players can seek to any point in the video
- Audio players can skip to any point in the song
- Works with all modern browsers and players

### Performance Optimization

**For faster uploads/downloads:**

1. Move closer to the WiFi router
2. Ensure router is in an open location (not in a cabinet or drawer)
3. Reduce the number of devices connected to WiFi
4. Upload/download during off-peak hours
5. Use 5 GHz WiFi if your router supports it (faster but shorter range)

**For better stability:**

1. Use a wired Ethernet connection on the server if possible
2. Update your router firmware
3. Use a modern WiFi standard (WiFi 6 or later)
4. Reduce other network traffic

**For large files:**

1. Split files into smaller parts before uploading
2. Use a wired connection on the client device
3. Connect the server via Ethernet if possible

## Security

### Security Model

Vortex is designed for trusted local networks. Understand the security implications before use.

### Default Security (No Flags)

When run with `vortex --start` only:

- No encryption: Traffic visible to anyone on the network
- No authentication: Anyone with the URL can upload/download
- No authorization: All files are accessible to anyone
- Rate limiting: Always enabled (200 requests/minute per IP)

Use this mode only on networks you fully trust.

### Optional Security Features

**Token authentication (`--secure`):**
- Requires users to provide a secret token
- Prevents unauthorized access from people on the same network
- Token is 16 random characters
- Does not encrypt traffic (use `--https` for encryption)

**HTTPS encryption (`--https`):**
- Encrypts all traffic between browser and server
- Prevents eavesdropping on the network
- Uses self-signed certificate (browsers may warn)
- Does not authenticate users (use `--secure` for authentication)

**Rate limiting (always enabled):**
- Limits requests to 200 per minute per IP address
- Protects against brute force attacks
- Cannot be disabled

### Security Use Cases

**Home network with trusted family:**

```bash
vortex --start
```

No security features needed.

**Office network with colleagues:**

```bash
vortex --start --secure
```

Token authentication prevents random access.

**Public WiFi (coffee shop, airport):**

```bash
vortex --start --https --secure
```

Both encryption and authentication for maximum security.

**Sharing sensitive documents:**

```bash
vortex --start --https --secure
```

Plus: Encrypt files before uploading, delete files immediately after sharing.

### Security Limitations

Important limitations to understand:

- Self-signed certificates are not trusted by browsers
- Tokens are transmitted in URLs (visible in browser history)
- Files are not encrypted on disk
- HTTPS only encrypts in-transit data
- Rate limiting can be bypassed from multiple IP addresses

### Firewall Considerations

### Windows Firewall

By default, Windows Firewall may block Vortex.

When you start Vortex, Windows may show a firewall permission dialog. Click "Allow" to permit network access.

If no dialog appears:

1. Open Settings
2. Go to Privacy & Security
3. Click Firewall & network protection
4. Click "Allow an app through firewall"
5. Click "Change settings"
6. Click "Allow another app"
7. Browse to your Python installation
8. Select python.exe
9. Click Open
10. Check "Private" and "Public" boxes
11. Click OK

### macOS Firewall

By default, macOS allows applications.

If you see a firewall prompt, click "Allow".

To verify firewall settings:

1. System Preferences
2. Security & Privacy
3. Firewall Options

### Linux Firewall

If using a firewall like UFW:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 8000/tcp
```

Replace 8000 with your custom port if using one.

## Troubleshooting

### Server Issues

#### Server fails to start

**Problem:** `Address already in use`

This means port 8000 is already in use by another application.

Solution:

```bash
vortex --start --port 9000
```

Replace 9000 with any unused port.

**Problem:** `Permission denied` when accessing directory

You do not have read permissions for the specified directory.

Solution 1: Use a directory you own:

```bash
vortex --start --dir ~/Downloads
```

Solution 2: Grant read permissions:

macOS/Linux:

```bash
chmod -R 755 /path/to/directory
vortex --start --dir /path/to/directory
```

Windows: Right-click directory → Properties → Security → Edit permissions

**Problem:** `No such file or directory`

The specified directory does not exist.

Solution: Check the path spelling and ensure the directory exists:

```bash
vortex --start --dir ~/MyExistingFolder
```

#### Server runs but is not accessible

**Problem:** Browser shows "ERR_TIMED_OUT" or "took too long to respond"

Your firewall is blocking port 8000.

Solution - Windows:

1. Open Windows Defender Firewall
2. Click Advanced Settings
3. Click Inbound Rules
4. Click New Rule
5. Select Port
6. Click Next
7. Select TCP
8. Enter Port: 8000
9. Click Next
10. Select "Allow the connection"
11. Click Next
12. Check all three: Domain, Private, Public
13. Click Next
14. Enter Name: "Vortex"
15. Click Finish

Restart Vortex:

```bash
vortex --stop
vortex --start
```

Solution - macOS:

macOS typically allows applications. If blocked:

1. System Preferences
2. Security & Privacy
3. Firewall
4. Firewall Options
5. Add Python to allowed apps

Solution - Linux:

If using UFW firewall:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 8000/tcp
```

**Problem:** "Connection refused" on another device

The server is running but the address is wrong.

Solution: Verify the IP address shown when server starts:

```bash
vortex --start
```

Check the output for the address shown (example: `http://192.168.1.100:8000`).

Ensure both devices are on the same WiFi network.

### HTTPS Issues

#### HTTPS does not work

**Problem:** "Certificate error" or "Connection refused"

OpenSSL is not installed.

Solution - Windows:

Download and install from: [slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)

Restart your computer after installation.

Solution - macOS:

```bash
brew install openssl
```

Solution - Linux:

Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install openssl
```

Fedora/RHEL:

```bash
sudo yum install openssl
```

After installation, restart Vortex:

```bash
vortex --stop
vortex --start --https
```

**Problem:** Browser always warns about certificate

This is normal with self-signed certificates. The warning does not indicate a problem.

Solution: Click through the warning as described in the Web Interface section.

### Token Authentication Issues

#### Token not working

**Problem:** "403 Unauthorized" when accessing with token

The token is incorrect or misformatted.

Solution 1: Check the token spelling in the URL:

```
http://192.168.1.100:8000?token=EXACTTOKENFROMSERVER
```

Solution 2: Regenerate a new token:

```bash
vortex --start --secure --new-token
```

Use the new token shown in the output.

**Problem:** Forgot the token

The token is stored in `~/.vortex/token.txt`.

Retrieve it:

macOS/Linux:

```bash
cat ~/.vortex/token.txt
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
Get-Content $env:USERPROFILE\.vortex\token.txt
```

### Network Issues

#### Cannot see address from terminal output

The server is running but the address is not displaying correctly.

Solution: Check the terminal output carefully. Look for a line starting with `Share this on your network:`.

If not visible, the output may have scrolled. Restart the server:

```bash
vortex --stop
vortex --start
```

#### Server address shows localhost instead of IP

**Problem:** Output shows `http://127.0.0.1:8000` instead of `http://192.168.x.x:8000`

This means the server detected no network connection.

Solution 1: Connect to WiFi and restart:

```bash
vortex --stop
vortex --start
```

Solution 2: Force LAN mode:

```bash
vortex --start --mode lan
```

If this fails, no network is available.

#### Different address on different networks

The IP address changes when you move to a different WiFi network.

This is normal. Restart the server on the new network and use the new address displayed.

### Browser Issues

#### Browser shows security warning for HTTPS

This is expected with self-signed certificates.

Solution: Click through the warning:

Chrome/Edge: Click Advanced → Proceed to 192.168.x.x (unsafe)

Firefox: Click Advanced → Accept the Risk and Continue

Safari: Click Show Details → visit this website

#### Download not starting

**Problem:** File download does not begin after clicking

Possible causes: Large file, slow network, browser issue.

Solution 1: Wait longer (large files take time)

Solution 2: Try a different browser

Solution 3: Download as ZIP: Click "Download All" instead

#### File uploads fail or are slow

**Problem:** Upload gets stuck or times out

Possible causes: Large file, WiFi issues, network congestion.

Solution 1: Move closer to router

Solution 2: Reduce file size

Solution 3: Try uploading a smaller file first to test connection
